	description "The Star Queen is a relic of a more peaceful period of galactic history: a luxury liner for high-end tourists. Every cabin has its own mini-bar, and the bathrooms have marble tile and showers that use actual hot water instead of chemicals or sonic vibrations."

	description `A previous owner of this Manta has gone to great lengths to make sure they could bring all six gun ports to bear in a hurry, and chase down smaller warships. Style was not lost on that captain, and a forked tail yielded a little more space for shield projectors in an area that would have been destabilized by engine exhaust. If its dry tonnage were any higher, it would be classified as a heavy warship.`
