	description `A previous owner of this Manta has gone to great lengths to make sure they could bring all six gun ports to bear in a hurry, and chase down smaller warships. Style was not lost on that captain, and a forked tail yielded a little more space for shield projectors in an area that would have been destabilized by engine exhaust. If its dry tonnage were any higher, it would be classified as a heavy warship.`

	description "While the Starling was the first successful ship to use technology derived from alien ruins, the Gull is the most recent. The Extended Gull takes this to a new level, progressing part way from analogue to something not quite digital."
