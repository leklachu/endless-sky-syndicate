Flow of the Syndicate storyline
-------------------------------

# Pull yourself up by your bootstraps

These useless workers mean your position and comfortable life are in jeapordy.
You take to the stars, only to realise you're in massvie debt without a plan.

Start:

- massive debts, no money
- arranged a Star Queen bought with company money
- poorly outfitted and all depreciated

An assigned staff/copilot(?) for the ship advises you for intro

- can choose "bugger off" and auto-launch with 1 crew (yourself). Allows FW storyline; shuts off syndicate storyline

Your concern is to get out of the financial mess you're in

- missions to overcome the massive debt
- attitude of workers are useless and unhelpful and poor-of-mind, etc
- missions from uncles, old colleagues etc.; they don't treat you as equal, more like scum same as any worker

FW intro:

- not offered the FW intro jobs
- Katja offers job, but only option is the karate kick

This develops into:

# Rescue the Syndicate

The Syndicate: the company, the managers, indeed the population (not that they
matter...), are facing recession. Can you help them avoid it and get to new
prosperity?

- will vary a bit depending on whether the terrorist strike has happened
  - or can modify the terror event to only happen when you're at right place in mission
- help transport fissile material to clink and/or near-navy-base could happen only if terror attack not yet happened
  - this mission could happen early in bootstraps

Participate in FW events

- encourage/exploit/benefit-from Navy expansion
- escorts to Tarazed: Wolf Pack attacks on the return leg
- participate in supplying pirate-alphas with nukes, without really knowing what's going on
- try to capture Ijs (before rescued by FW protagonist)
- 10T parts to Tundra/Cebalrai for FW Pirate Diplomacy Thule

Other missions

- transport executives to various places (need luxury outfit)
- join a fight against a Korath
- transport an alpha (knowingly? unknowingly?)
- exploit the war for personal riches, and riches of those who 'might help' you

Connections with alphas

- but not yet aware they are alphas

Your uncle(?) and his multiple wives

- various missions
- starts to draw you into questioning attitudes
- comparisons to alphas and their women

(Some of this bleeds into previous/next section.)

As your attitudes change, this changes to:

# Reform the Syndicate and bring peace in the galaxy

You've begun to think differently from Syndicate management, and care about
people other than yourself. Can you bring change? Maybe you can help the galaxy
too...

Participate in FW events

- help the defector, and pass information/hints to the free worlds
- OR hinder the defector for the sake of the Syndicate-worlds population who would suffer
  - leads to a storyline of rooting out extremists and eventually raiding alpha pirate base
- (later) pressure/force the CEO to consider his resignation
- Transport CEOs/whatevers to FW diplomacy meeting
- make sure the police-actioned economist is in the right place at the right time

Other missions

- protect a planet raided by militia after FW: reconciliation

Union Busting / Helping

- help or bust some unions
- not all unions are bad
- choices determine who will help you later (cf. karma)
- this could be a significant sub-plot

Bringing Extremists to justice

- This also a major sub-plot
- track-down/identify extremists
- chase, capture, destroy
- assist others who are working against extremists
  - including some non-syndicate who are going after the extremists
- shelter an extremist who wants out OR bring him to justice anyway

Meanwhile:

# The Alphas have attacked various planets and captured young women

Alphas have abducted a number of young women. Join an effort to pursue them and
rescue as may of the women as possible.

- blockade(s)
- ground raid(s)
- destroy escaping ships
- board escaping ships

Expose situation to or hide it from the Oathbreakers

- and thus get or don't get their help
- If they help, you can force ships onto ground, and navy can chase, kill alphas and rescue captives
- if not help, blow up ships in orbit with everyone inside

You end up pursuing one particular ship as it evades blockades and heads to
who-knows-where

- Pursue that ship
- get to know the people involved (mothers, friends, leaked communications from the ship)
- alphas + captives change ship to evade; see evidence and lorien-leaves from old ship
  - perhaps you capture the ship and find it's a decoy or old ship

But:

# Stuck in Pug space

You're stuck in Pug space. Maybe you can find the Alpha's ship easier, because it's also stuck now?

- help from union(s)-helped or compan(y/ies) with busted unions
- maybe the pug are in league with the Alphas?
- you nearly catch alphas, but they jump-drive out before you can catch them
  - if you see them jump-drive out, is there risk player with OP weapons can kill them?

Oppose the pug

- can you fight the pug to take them out and free humanity?
- capture a jump drive to chase the alphas

Collaborate with the pug

- ask pug for help... what do they say?
- pug provide ship with jump drive? or something? one-time wormhole? cf. elves-help-deep-against-alphas-long-ago
- would be cool if this gives a unique outfit reward

Finally escape and pursue that alpha ship

- Ultimately land on Alg-whatsit, the alpha pirate world
- "you go and protect the captives/family"
- and black out. Or imprisoned. Or similar
- rescued by navy
- then you find pug-space reconnected etc.

End
