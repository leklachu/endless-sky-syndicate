# Stuck in the Pug

You pursue the Alphas into soon-to-be-pug-space..... and... ?!?!?!

- now you're stuck. news from the worlds a la FW options
- travel round to see what's happened. Suspect Alphas?
	+ warning: new central system might be alpha controlled!
	+ Are the Pug the new evolution/GM of the alphas?

If you travel to deneb

- usual dialog with pug, tailored for ScS
- leave in confusion and suspicion

Or go straight to your friends on ??

- (they're from the union or company)
- They update you, also saw Alphas shoot down a pug ship, board, leave and blow it up before disappearing
- guess at direction of travel, ?? within pug region
- chase the alphas there, watch them jump out
	+ Is that too risky? Do they need to jump off-stage so you can't go and blow them up with OP weaponary?
	+ Or just fail mission for blowing them up!
		* have not-disableable and plenty of ion/etc resistance.
		* Even a jump drive that works with movement
		* Not actually same game-engine stats as version captured later
	+ Or alternate sad ending for blowing them up?
		* Head later to buccaneer bay on revenge instead of rescue

Return to your friends. What to do? They invite you to join in rebellion against the pug, then they'll help you track the alphas

- Take part in a battle on ??, and steal a jump drive from a disabled pug.
	+ "actually I have a jump drive already" but you still have to join the battle to get the help
- land and pick up data to bring to your friends' contacts on ?? in syndicate space
- contacts analyse data and have observations of their own: you need to head to planet-next-to-mutiny
	+ or maybe mutiny itself? alphas helped with research
	+ warning of jump drive fuel consumption: you're heading to an area hard to refuel
- underworld (or researcher) contacts there have seen alpha ship pass (perhaps refuelling), go to buccaneer bay.
- (Do you get unique reward from friends? or just alpha ship with tech at the end?)
	+ and what if killed alphas? No unique reward?
		* Perhaps that's fine: if you killed alphas you probably have plenty of alien tech

OR your friends want you to join a rebellion against the pug, but you think maybe the pug can help

- go to pugglemug/squat to talk
- 'you daft humans and your genetic experiment' etc 'you'd kill yourselves if not helped'
- can still decide fed up with derogatory pug: GOTO friends
- Pug help you chase
	+ or one-off wormhole a la terminus: need a resonance stone (given by pug) to get through
	+ plus some pug happy-staves
	+ if you killed alphas, pug see no need to help. GOTO friends for revenge
- pug point you direct to buccaneer bay
	+ warning about refuelling? in characteristic pug mocking style

You chase the alpha ship in hot pursuit, and land on buccaneer bay. Story time.

- Track alphas to base
- If you helped pug, use happy-stick to dispatch guards en route, eventually finding and freeing the remaining prisoners
	+ flee from alphas searching for you, and find a place to hide out
	+ "..." (many days?)
- OR if helped rebellion, use their tech to track which way they went
	+ (how? Do the girls have a tracker? Are the alphas carrying something that emits a trace)
	+ But you get captured and locked in a cell with them
	+ protect them valiantly from abuse & impregnation
	+ locked together in a deeper cell
	+ "..." (many days?)
- OR if you killed the alphas, run in guns blazing.
	+ kill some.
	+ Blow up an important comm system
	+ eventually captured
	+ maybe tortured for information, but you resist
	+ "..."

And at last, fighting outside, explosions, voices, peace

- behold, the navy has rescued you
- meanwhile war has ended, pug have left, Korban is out.
- if rescued girls instead of blowing up alpha ship, find the hidden alpha ship you followed (hint it's near yours) and get it
	+ with a jump drive and some sweet tech
- return to (family location(s)? arranged place to reconcile girls to families?)
	+ Hooray, you're a hero :-) :-)
- OR if destroyed alpha ship, return with the sad news
	+ still they thank you for doing your best, and for taking out the alphas who dared

Epilogue:

- visit women's group
- visit WCW wives
- visit ARA
- visit WCW?

# notes

if alpha romeo jumps from pug-space on-screen, how far will game engine let you follow? Can you end up on Buccaneer bay? If so, or if you go without pursuing story, should you complete anyway?
