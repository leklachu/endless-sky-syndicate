# Reform the Syndicate

(and bring peace to the galaxy)

one of WCW's wives reaches out to you

- (give the wife a name of course! she's not defined by bing WCWW)
- (different depending on whether you helped them before)
	+ could be the one you relocated
- A young family (Joe and ?? from Thule) need hospital treatment for their baby but can't afford time off, can you help?
- Joe et al put you in touch with a band of young men who meant to save up to marry their girlfriends, but are now stuck in bad contracts
- A company sends revenge after you: Do you
	+ shoot the ships out of the sky, but anger the Syndicate (not to full hostility)
		* A message comes: meet me in ?? in republic space
	+ OR lead them to republic space where they're intercepted and arrested

A republic armchair--rights-activist (cue hilarious misunderstanding) reaches out to you

- (maybe he's disabled? that's why he doesn't go himself but you don't know it yet)
- Now you're in the thick of it! A company is feigning loss to avoid paying workers, but transporting profit secretly as credit chips to ?? for CEO and board bonuses. Intercept the shipment: ARA will ensure you're not targeted by syndicate for it
- make connections between certain workers' groups in syndicate space
	+ transport people for meetings
	+ ...
- Rescue protestors before they're caught by syndicate-sponsored 'pirates'
- (another mission here?)

ARA says a union is forming, will you help them?

- or will you bust them?
	+ perhaps the workers will get hurt?
	+ perhaps the union bosses are just as greedy and manipulative, taking advantage of people in hard places for their own benefit
- How will you know? Perhaps WCWW can help. Get in touch with her
- Look for evidence of grassroots activism
- Look for evidence of union bad intentions
	+ and past groups this union's instigators might have come out of
	+ (hear their stories, good and bad)
- Which leads you to pirate-world connection
	+ (what are they doing? recruiting disgruntled workers? Standing amorally against Syndicate leaders? hosting union or anti-syndicate activities/planning? siphoning resources from company? providing workers with resources, good and/or bad?)

Decide to help the union

- ...missions
- this sets up union on ?? in pug space who will help you later

OR Decide to bust the union

- ...missions
- grateful company bosses on ?? in pug space will help you later

(Take a break here?)

events: most of fw occupying north -> dreadnoughts for sale (but not events: dreadnoughts for sale... or yes but need FW licence)

ARA reaches out to you again: a group on ?? (synd space) wants your help

- (group is led by a woman)
- (group informs you that ARA is physically unable to travel otherwise he'd be out in the thick of it too, but instead he coordinates many efforts, gathering information and helping people from his armchair back home)
- The problem, they say, boils down to syndicate top leadership, and things have got worse in the last few years. Can you help find out what's going on.
	+ (they want to overturn syndicate leadership)
	+ If gave Navy Expert to Syndicate: contact Ben Downey direct
	+ Or if gave to WCW, contact WCW who puts you back in touch with Downey

Pretend to work for Downey for a while

- (get salary again, higher this time)
- (handwave your previous anti-syndicate stuff away? Or they don't know of it)
- (is downey an extremist or just regular high syndicate?)
- (salary increase now working for Downey)
- Escort Downey to meeting on pirate world?
- Bring sensitive documents to ??
- ...?

Operation Coventry. Downey wants you to blow up a ship of mass-resigning employees because some know things too sensitive

- find out when/where the ship is leaving
- arrange a secret transport for the workers
	+ uses the cloaking device? Help from the Hephaestus Engineers?
- (is it moral to trick a bad pirate into piloting?)
	+ Or is there a brave captain ready to sacrifice his life?
	+ or go with automation plot (below):
- Ask ARA if automation can be found
- Travel to Deep to get automation tech; back to source planet to install
- launch and blow up decoy ship
- meet with fugitives

The fugitives have information that shows an extremist faction within Syndicate leadership, and a plot to catch two who are escaping

- Downey contacts you and asks you to catch another traitor with information he shouldn't have, ('some of it lies'?)
	+ You put two and two together: he's a former extremist who wants to put that behind him and retire to (hai space?).
	+ help him escape
	+ OR bring him to justice anyway, exposing him on the way
- The second would-be escapee is Sawyer, the scientist you met.
	+ Help him escape and furnish him with documents he can show
		* (in FW he shows evidence to monks, who relay that info)
		* (maybe some is his documents: help him retrieve them)
	+ OR decide too many innocent syndicate workers will suffer this way,
		* better to deal with it within the syndicate:
		* poison his evidence
		* and warn Downey who can prepare less-naive-sounding statement to FW
		* (starts different ending)
		
# notes

- idea: rescue someone (Sawyer?) by boarding friendly ship, and 'he slips aboard' while the ship appears to be rescued and carries on
