# The Alphas Strike Again

...before this, precursor of managers ordering health checkups. ARA and WG investigate (and have you investigate?) because sexual harassment/discrimination and possible grooming/prostitution

after helping sawyer escape, before he reaches there, Alphas strike (one or more) planet(s) in West Syndicate, abducting young women

- (and preventing you from getting sawyer out completely clear from syndicate, hence his pursuit in FW-line)
- Report this to Danforth/navy for help
- OR keep it quiet
- ...missions chasing alphas
- blockade created
- if Danforth: force ship to ground, navy rescues women
- else: blow ship out of the sky
- evidence from ship about some alphas + women moved to another ship
	+ if blown up, evidence from wreckage
- No way to follow; so Danforth needs to be back with new changes between FW and Republic
	+ (he doesn't say what those are - they're sawyer and the war-change)


on landing, (or next day? two-three days?) you find FW-Republic truce, and Syndicate-FW hostile.

- Downey warns of a Militia attack on a Syndicate world and asks you to defend. So you do that,
- and take the opportunity (how?) to expose him to syndicate leadership.

... extremist chase/capture/destroy missions

- and helping anti-extremist syndicates
- making sure police-actioned economist in right place right time
- leading to evidence, blame, pressure -> Korban. indirectly confront/incriminate him as pressure to resign and upheave syndicate leadership
- preparing for women's group to have significant power

... meanwhile hints of the alphas: get to know the families they've kept, 

- 'lorien leaf' evidence left by prisoners
- meet prisoners' famil(ies)
- ARA and others working hard to fence off Alphas from escaping to remote worlds
- brief communication with prisoners on ship
- catch a decoy ship
- rescue some of the group as alphas change from e.g. blackbird to bounder(i.e. smaller capacity; n.b. alphas can squish prisoners into fewer bunks obvs)
	+ inc 1 of twin sisters; other is in group still 
- leave your own decoy ship for the alphas to switch to
	+ they don't take the bait?
	+ They disable your overrides/trackers?
	+ Your trackers work? <-
